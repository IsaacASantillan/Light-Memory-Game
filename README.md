# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Isaac Alejandro Santillan**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

One challenge I encountered in creating this submission was figuring out the syntax of JavaScript. It was a cross between my favorite language of Python and a current language I am learning right now called Scheme. So it was tricky creating assignment statements and function names. I also struggled with leaving in semicolons after almost every line. Even though I realize it’s considered good practice in JavaScript, I personally did not see their use in organizing my code. What’s more, I also had trouble accepting the fact that you could add integers and strings together in the lightButton and clearButton functions as that is a huge syntax error in Python. I also had trouble understanding the purpose of using var for assignment statements. Since it was optional to put the var, I didn’t see the purpose in adding it, however after digging around on Google, I found out that it doesn't really matter in the Global Frame, but using them in functions signifies a local variable. I also struggled with learning how name lookup works in JavaScript. I was unsure if they first looked in the global frame, or their parent class. However, I was able to understand it a bit better after reading some JavaScript Documentation.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

Since I have been unable to land a technical Computer Science internship during my time at UC Berkeley, I would like to learn more about the roles of front end vs backend developers and how their different roles affect what languages they use. I am interested in web development myself, so learning more about the daily tasks of both sides would be extremely helpful in choosing what roles I may want to play in my future career. I am also interested in learning how teams at tech companies work on web development together and how different teams function for one website or project. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would spend more time adding additional features like keeping track of scores and how to save a high score. I would also add the option to customize the color of the buttons, as well as their texture. I think adding customization would increase the time users spend on the web page and make the game feel more personalized. I would also add modes of difficulty, where easy mode would have four buttons to memorize, while difficult mode would have 8 buttons to memorize in order to let the user decide their level of enjoyment.
